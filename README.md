Youtube Videos Hider is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to make a list of the youtube videos you don't want to see on your subscriptions page. For example, if you're subscribed to a guy that makes a Borderlands series that you don't want to watch, you can prevent it from appearing on the youtube homepage.
